Project:
In Uganda, land deeds are hard to come by and they are a vehicle for social mobility. 
Funded by the world bank, appromixately 30 people got land grants and deeds. 
Given the patriarchial structure of Ugandan society, men are the primary caregivers and power holders in a marriage. 
While all people were offered a land grant/deed, for some people, it came with a condition: the husband had to put their wife on the deed. 

Ultimately, I want to quantify if there is any ill will.

The joint.docx file is an in-depth interview of a women whose family recieved a land grant/deed under the condition that the husband put his wife's name on the deed. 
The single.docx file is an in-depth interview of a women whose family recieved a land grant/deed under no condition. The husband decided not to put the wife's name on the deed.

The nlp.ipynb is my first attempt at trying to conduct a sentiment analysis on these texts. 

My issues?: 
1. Theres a limit to how much text I can feed the sentiment analysis algorithim. Is it reading in all the text? What is the limit? ChatGPT says there is a 512 token limit.
   If it is not reading in all the text, then how would I know. 
3. The results are similar for the two interviews. Could it be because it was trained on US data and not on Ugandan English data?
4. Should I get rid of anything else for this analysis?
5. Do you have any suggestions for a model I could run?
